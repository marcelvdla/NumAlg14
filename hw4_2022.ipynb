    "# Sparse matrices\n",
    "A _sparse matrix_ or _sparse array_ is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition how many elements need to be zero for a matrix to be considered sparse. In many examples, the number of nonzeros per row or column is a small fraction, a few percent or less, of the total number of elements of the row or column. By contrast, if most of the elements are nonzero, then the matrix is considered _dense_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of software for scientific computing, a sparse matrix typically refers to a storage format, in which elements which are known to be zero are not stored. In Python, the library `scipy.sparse` defines several sparse matrix classes, such as `scipy.sparse.coo_matrix`. To construct such an object, one passes for each nonzero element the value, and the row and column coordinates. In some cases, one can also just pass the nonzero (off-)diagonals, see `scipy.sparse.diags`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions for dense matrices do not always work with sparse matrices. For example for the product of a sparse matrix with a (dense) vector, there is the member function `scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.dot`, and for solving linear equations involving a sparse matrix, there is the function `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve`."
